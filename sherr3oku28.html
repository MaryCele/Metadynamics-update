From 10 years ago work&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Eichner_2009}</cite> , we know that assembly is shown to involve the transient formation of a non-native monomer containing a trans backbone conformation. subsequently there is the formation of dimeric species and higher aggregates that accumulate before the development of amyloid fibrils.

These species are obtained when Pro32, starting from the normal cis-conformation, slowly adapts to trans geometry, leading to destabilizing effects on the structure of the protein: in particular there is an exposition of the hydrophobic structure and also a rearrangement of the D strand that lead to intermolecular aggregation. </div><div></div><div>Beta-2 microglobulin (β2m) is part of the Major Histocompatibility  Complex Class I (MHC I) and when monomeric becomes an aggregation prone  protein that is responsible for a human disorder known as  dialysis-related amyloidosis. In 2012 Valleix et al. described a new  familial systemic amyloidosis: an unreported β2m mutant (D76N) is the  etiological agent of such disease. Main symptoms were chronic diarrhea,  loss of weight and polyneuropathy: large amyloid deposits were found in  internal organs. From the biophysical point of view, the D76N β2m is  much less stable and more amyloidogenic than wt β2m; however, its  crystal structure reveals very minor conformational changes compared  with the wt protein&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{de_Rosa_2017}</cite></div><div></div><div>The  six Asp in β2m sequence have been mutated to Asn (D-to-N mutants):  their thermal stability and aggregation propensity closely resemble  those of wt β2m; from the structural point of view only the D38N  mutation triggers non-negligible conformational changes, however the  structural rearrangements observed in the C-D region do not correlate  with an increased aggregation propensity [<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13506129.2016.1272450#">5</a> de Rosa M, Barbiroli A, Giorgetti S, Mangione PP, Bolognesi M, Ricagno S.
