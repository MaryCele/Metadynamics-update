<div>We will evaluate separately&nbsp;<i>cis</i> and&nbsp;<i>trans</i> geometry.</div><div>Analysing the<b> CIS configuration</b>, we discovered a good stability in the protein structure as the RMSD of the protein shows, although there is a deep shift of the AB loop toward the strand D (see the plot). Such rearrangement, that does not vary during the metadynamics, is stabilized by the formation of a salt bridge between Glu16 and Arg12.</div><div>Furthermore, very few molecules of water are able to enter in the protein structure</div><div></div><div></div>
