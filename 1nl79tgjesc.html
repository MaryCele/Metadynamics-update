<div>Evaluating the RDF for the Oxygen of the dihedral angle defining the Proline isomerisation, it can be said that neither from the outside nor the inside with water molecules inside the structure there is a relevant interaction with the solvent for the hotspot Pro32.</div><div>The Proline environment interaction with water molecules has been  evaluated with the Radial Distribution Function, looking at Calpha 484  and O498 of HIS31, and O512 of Pro32.</div>
