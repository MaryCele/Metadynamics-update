Among all the amino acids that are the basics of protein composition, Proline is the most unusual one: it has a cyclic side chain that is bound to the amide nitrogen of the backbone  

\cite{Eichner_2009}
The isomerisation of Pro32 from its native cis to the non-native trans configuration is indicated as a trigger factor for b2m misfolding and the subsequent amyloidogenical mechanism.
Cis-configuration for the Proline 32 (the other 4 proline are in trans configuration) is required in order to maintain the soluble native state of B2M wild type, while trans-configuration is required for amyloid elongation at neutral pH. From 10 years ago work \cite{Eichner_2009} , we know that assembly is shown to involve the transient formation of a non-native monomer containing a trans backbone conformation. subsequently there
