<div>Analysing the<b> TRANS configuration</b>, we find the same behavior for the AB loop in terms of rearrangement, whereas in the classical MD for the TransProline is not present. In such configuration, some water molecule is able to enter the structure, in particular around Arg45.</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="933046" class="ltx_title_subsection">The amyloidogenical variant D76N</h2><div>Proceeding with simulation, the Pro32 is stuck for a very long time in trans configuration, that is expected for the amyloidogenical variant.</div><div></div>
