We can say, observing the gaussian deposition and the variation of the collective variables in time that the more the simulation goes on, the less the isomerisation happens. The hypothesis we can do is that, considering singularly each case, it is more easy to remain stuck in a certain basin and now, as the height of the gaussian is very low, it takes a very long time to overcome the barrier and visit the other conformation.</div><div>Then, observing the behavior in the last part of the simulation, after 1microsecond, could be misleading as we are maybe seeing conformation led by the water more than the CVs we selected.</div><div></div><div>Comparing the evolution of the Zeta dihedral, the most relevant one, we decided to perform analysis in the interval between 800ns and 1000ns, as for each variant both of the geometry are well explored (even if not with a diffusive behavior).</div><div></div><h2 data-label="945144" class="ltx_title_subsection">The wild type</h2><div></div>
