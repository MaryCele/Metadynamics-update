From 10 years ago work \cite{Eichner_2009} , we know that assembly is shown to involve the transient formation of a non-native monomer containing a trans backbone conformation. subsequently there is the formation of dimeric species and higher aggregates that accumulate before the development of amyloid fibrils. (This is the milestone for Radford and co to say that Pro32 isomerisation</div><div></div>
