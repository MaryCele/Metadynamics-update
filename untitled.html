From 10 years ago work&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Eichner_2009}</cite> , we know that assembly is shown to involve the transient formation of a non-native monomer containing a trans backbone conformation. subsequently there is the formation of dimeric species and higher aggregates that accumulate before the development of amyloid fibrils.

Such substitution alters the equilbrium population of trans and cis isomers via stereoelectronics effects and also lowers the barrier for the isomerisation.</div><div>Previous studies showed that trans to cis prolyl bond isomerisation of Pro32 is the rate-limiting step in the protein folding mechanism.</div><div>Experimental works suggested that fibril formation occurs via metastable, partially unfolded protein conformers. These species are obtained when Pro32, starting from the normal cis-conformation, slowly adapts to trans geometry, leading to destabilizing effects on the structure of the protein: in particular there is an exposition of the hydrophobic structure and also a rearrangement of the D strand that lead to intermolecular aggregation. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="501673" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div></div><div></div><h1>The behavior of the proteins during the classical MD trajectories</h1><h2 data-label="232207" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="232207" class="ltx_title_subsection">OBSERVING TRANS-PRO32 MD</h2>
