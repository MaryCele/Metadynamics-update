<div>While the other portions of the protein are vibrating interacting with the water molecules, DE loop rearranges itself starting from a very open configuration towards the solvent and getting closer to the BC loop where the trans Pro32 is located. This can be observed from the total RMSD of the system, that lowers during time suggesting a more compact structure, and the distances between Gly60 and Pro32 (DE and BC loop) and Thr86 and Pro32 (FG and BC loop). While the last bond does not vary in time, the first describes with an abrupt change how the DE loop closes.</div><div></div>
