<h2 data-label="649064" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>Analyzing the&nbsp;<b>TRANS</b> configuration, we observe that the Pro32 is completely buried by His31 and Ser33. Ser33 is openend toward the solvent in the first 200ns of the simulation but then there is the pocket formation.&nbsp; In fact, there is a profound difference between the RDF for O529 in trans (black curve) wrt to CIS.</div><div>Analyzing&nbsp;<b>CIS</b> configuration, we can see that here the O529 is largely exposed to water</div><div>Furthermore, it is found that there is a high number of molecule inside the apical part of the protein opposite to Pro32, namely CD-EF-AB loop. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
