<div>Analyzing the&nbsp;<b>TRANS configuration</b>, Pro32 switch from being very close to Thr86 to being close to Gly60. In the first rearrangement, there is&nbsp; no space for water molecules inside the protein structure as the side chain of the underlying residues occupy the space. When BC loop goes toward DE loop, some solvent can actually enters (more or less 5 in the same empty space). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Analyzing the&nbsp;<b>CIS configuration</b>, here Pro32 has a constant configuration and same distance from DE and FG loops for the entire dynamics.&nbsp;</div><div>As RDF shows, in both conformations, His31-Pro32 peptide bond is exposed and interacting with water and we al</div>
