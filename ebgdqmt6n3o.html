We can say, observing the gaussian deposition and the variation of the collective variables in time that the more the simulation goes on, the less the isomerisation happens. The hypothesis we can do is that, considering singularly each case, it is more easy to remain stuck in a certain basin and now, as the height of the gaussian is very low, it takes a very long time to overcome the barrier and visit the other conformation.</div><div>Then, observing the behavio</div><div></div><h2 data-label="945144" class="ltx_title_subsection">The wild type</h2>
